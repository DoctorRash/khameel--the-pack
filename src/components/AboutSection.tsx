                He started in the dark learning, losing, rebuilding. Now, he's back.

                Khameel is a producer-singer from Lagos, Nigeria fusing Afrobeat with 
                goth aesthetics and futuristic sound. His music is raw but refined, 
                melodic stories layered with pain, power, and swagger.

                It's not just about making hits. It's about owning your story,

                No rules, just presence. Every beat, every bar, every move is a step 
                away from the old system and into something self-built.
